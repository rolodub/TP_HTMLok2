It features the MP4 reference muxer MP4Box, and many other tools. You can find more on the GPAC tools page. It contains more than 650000 lines of code, and its website has been hit over 3 300 000 times during the last year.

GPAC is actually mainly hosted and made possible by Telecom ParisTech, one of the best technological universities of Paris, France. Kudos to them (and more below)!
